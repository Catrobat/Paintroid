# Paintroid
The Paintroid team is responsible for our graphical paint editor application "Pocket Paint", available on Android. Combined with "Pocket Code", it enables users to create even better games on their smartphones. If you are interested in contributing to our Paintroid team but have not used the "Pocket Paint" yet, it's about time to do so. Go back to "Pocket Code" and use the embedded editor to improve your game, or play with the [stand-alone version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.catrobat.paintroid) before proceeding! If you like "Pocket Paint" you are invited to make your first contribution by rating the app ;)
