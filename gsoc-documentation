# GSoC documentation Gerhard Fromm

As part of Summer of Code my project was to further expand the brush tool in Paintroid.
This was the initial plan. However these plans quickly changed when we discussed it while implementing the different tasks.
The new goal was to implement some advanced settings which effect multiple tools and extend the tool menu with 1 or 2 more tools.

# New additions:


# GSoC Tasks

1. Adding advanced setting: Antialiasing
Previously antialiasing was automatically on. The task was to 
implement a new option to switch it on and off via a new menu entry.
